# AlienInvasion
A 2D game where players control a spaceship to shoot down aliens. Shoot down all the aliens on the screen to advance to the next level. If the alien
hits the spaceship a certain number of times, the game is over. As the level gets higher, the aliens move faster, but the point value of the aliens 
increase as well.
